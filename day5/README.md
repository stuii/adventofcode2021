# Day 5
For fun, I added an engine to my script, which renders the given plot to a png. The more intersections, the "more dangerous" the color:

| # | color |
|---|---|
| 0 | grey |
| 1 | light green |
| 2 | slighty more visible green |
| 3 | orange |
| 4 | light red |
| 5 | full blown omfg super duper red |
